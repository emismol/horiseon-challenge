# Emily's Horiseon Project

# HTML & CSS Challenge One Acceptance Criteria 
In this activity we will work with an "on the ticket" request meaning we will be given starter code to work with and will have to identify any errors and impliment best practices to meet the criteria of our client, in this case Horiseon, a marketing agency. They want a codebase that follows accessibility standards so that the site is optimized for search engines. The webpage must have semantic HTML elements that follow a logical structure. All image elements must have accessible alt attributes. Heading attributes must fall in sequential order and the title must be concise and descriptive. 

## Instructions / Assets

## Clone the Repository 
* Navigate to the [Starter Code](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/urban-octo-telegram). To perform the clone operation, you'll need to use the `git clone` command from your command line. Make sure that you've navigated to the location you want your repository to be cloned to using the `cd` command, and then clone the repo with the following command:

  ```bash
  # replace the last value with the one you copied from your GitHub repository
  git clone git@github.com:lernantino/conflict-resolution.git
  ```

* Once it's done cloning to your machine, navigate to the cloned repository's directory using the `cd` command.

* It's done when the html & css meet all of the above acceptance criteria
